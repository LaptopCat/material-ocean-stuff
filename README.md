### Installing
First, download the theme file [here](https://laptopcat.github.io/material-ocean-stuff/themes/discord/Material-Discord.theme.css)
To use it, you will need a custom discord client like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app), but any other custom client for PC discord with theme support should work just fine (i didn't test it but you can)
After installing your custom client of choice, find the themes folder of your custom client (for BetterDiscord, go to settings -> themes and open themes folder) and place the downloaded file there.
