# Discord themes
## PC
An edited version of [Material Discord](https://github.com/CapnKitten/Material-Discord) with the [Material You](https://github.com/CapnKitten/BetterDiscord/tree/master/Themes/Material-Discord/css/addons/material-you) addon included and setup to have the Material Ocean accent color.

### Installing
First, download the theme file [here](https://laptopcat.github.io/material-ocean-stuff/themes/discord/Material-Discord.theme.css)

To use it, you will need a custom discord client like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app), but any other custom client for PC discord with theme support should work just fine (i didn't test it but you can)

After installing your custom client of choice, find the themes folder of your custom client (for BetterDiscord, go to settings -> themes and open themes folder) and place the downloaded file there.

## Android
Poorly-made fork of [Material Aliucord](https://github.com/A-rhyna-H/Material-Aliucord) to make it have Material Ocean colors. (React Native not supported)

### Installing
First, download the theme file [here](https://laptopcat.github.io/material-ocean-stuff/themes/discord/Material_Ocean.json)

To use it, you will need the [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) custom discord client (the old Kotlin version, not the new React Native one)

After installing Aliucord, download the [Themer](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/raw/builds/Themer.zip) plugin and move it to the /storage/emulated/0/Aliucord/plugins folder in your file manager.

After installing the Themer plugin, move the theme file to the /storage/emulated/0/Aliucord/themes/ folder in your file manager.

After installing both the theme and the plugin, open up Aliucord, go to settings and find the Plugins section, find the Themer plugin and click settings, Enable Custom Fonts and enable the Material Ocean theme.
